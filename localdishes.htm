<p><b><i>
 Etli ekmek is a pizza-like dish which originated in Konya and Sivas
 in Turkey.[1] “Etli ekmek” means "bread with meat" in Turkish. It is very common in cities in the central part
 of Turkey. Etli ekmek can be bought at Turkish bakeries but the customer usually also brings the prepared meat with them unless 
 the bakery makes it itself.</p></b></i>

 <p><b>This is special taste and my favorite dish because the first meaty dish I ate after giving up the vegetarian diet at the same time:). 
 Construction is very challenging and this meal can be cooked for eight hours.
Only the neck region of the lamb is used.The history of Gazyagcı Fırın Kebab place last until 1870 year and my first advise for you:.

 <p><b>
One of Konya's most popular dishes is meaty gombo soup , which is indispensable for weddings and special occasions.
You can see it all wedding meals so we can say this is a traditional taste.Dried flower gombos,beef and lemon juice give an original flavor.
 Okra are mostly served in an easily prepared stir-fry, almost always sharing centre-stage with fresh tomatoes. Okra contain a somewhat sticky and 
 interestingly tangy juice, which blends extraordinarily well with many other aromas and textures, adding a distinctive, but not overwhelming, flavour.
 In our Aegean version, cinnamon is used, as is so often the case in this part of the world,
 to deepen the complexity of the resulting flavours. Once you have mastered the recipe, you could try adding other spices, such as cardamon or rosemary.

As it is in many Anatolian cities, tirit also has a beautiful place in Konya Cuisine.
This meal takes place at the front of the table at weddings and special occasions.Tirit, also known as trit,
 is a meal prepared to avoid wasting dry bread. It is prepared by the broth of offals and cutting dry bread and 
 adding pepper powder and onion. There were also recipes with cheese and yogurt in a different Hatay resource
 cookery books. Tirit sometimes exists in Maka kitchen. Because there had been a drought for a year, they 
 offered Tirit to people and this way they felt cheerful.

This is a centuries-old recipe from the Central Asiatic Steppe. They used to cook with lamb meat and with left overs including mainly bread.</b></p>

 <p><b>
A taste that is as famous as a gumbo soup is a Arabası Soup.
Indispensable soup in winter and people prefered to eat with crowded.It is made with a tomato and pepper paste base, then 
chicken or meat added in, and some flour or rice. Then when it’s served, you slice up some watery-flour-dough dish, called Hamur,
 to mix in and balance out the heat and spice. Pour in some lemon juice, add in some more
 pepper, and if you’re very daring, pour on some pepper water too. Get a stack of napkins ready, because water will be gushing from
 every pore on your face.</b></p>
