<p><i><b>For Muslims and non-Muslims alike, the main reason to come to Konya is to visit the Mevlâna Museum, the former lodge 
of the whirling dervishes and home to the tomb of Celaleddin Rumi (later known as Mevlâna),
 who we have to thank for giving the world the whirling dervishes. This is one of the biggest pilgrimage centres in Turkey, 
 and the building's fluted dome of turquoise tiles is one of Turkey's most distinctive sights.The symbol of Konya is this tekke 
 (Sufi lodge) complex that holds the tomb of the 13th-century religious leader, philosopher, and poet Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi,
 who founded the whirling dervish sect of Sufism. The museum is set within lovingly-tended rose gardens, which you walk through to the
 ornate Dervişan Kapısı (Gate of the Dervishes). Once inside the complex, you enter the Mausoleum, which is the focus of much devotional 
 worship to this day. Mevlana's Tomb is at the far end, flanked by tombs of close family and followers. The Semahane (hall where dervish
 ceremonies were performed) is just to the left and contains a museum of religious exhibits. Across the courtyard from the Mausoleum is the 
 lodge kitchen, which contains dioramas of dervish life and is connected to the Dervish Cells, where Sufi followers would have lived and
 that now contain exhibits on dervish life.

<p><i><b>The Meram Vineyards located in the city of Meram in Konya and receiving the 
same name is one of the most visited and relaxed places of the city.
</p></i></b>
<br>
<p><i><b>
Meram Vineyards, defined as the lungs of Konya, have mentioned natural beauties throughout history. 
You should go to this magnificent promenade on your Konya trip and have a picnic in nature. Meram Stream flows
 through the middle of Meram Vineyards, which will fill your inside with new energy. In this area, there is information 
 about the Crusaders resting in the Second Crusade.

<br>
<a href="#"><img src="arkeoloji.jpg" width="330" height="220"align="ultra-expanded" ></a>
<p><i><b>Most of Turkey's archaeology museums have been jazzed-up and modernized 
in the past decade but not Konya's museum. This is a dusty old place with poor 
lighting and information panels that may as well be obsolete. But don't let that put you off, because
 the collection is excellent (and if you happen to like these relic museums with their treasure-hunt
 atmosphere, go now before it gets its much-needed facelift). There is a comprehensive display of finds 
 from the nearby archaeological site of Çatalhöyük and a wonderful collection of intricately decorated Roman sarcophagi.

Just down the road is Konya's Ethnography Museum, which holds a thorough collection of Turkish crafts, costumes,
 jewelry, carpets, and household goods but is sadly a bit dusty and unloved looking.

<a href="#"><img src="selimiye.jpg" width="380" height="240"align="ultra-expanded" ></a>
<p><i><b>Konya's Selimiye Camii (mosque), right next to the Mevlâna Museum, is an example 
of the Ottoman style of mosque from the great period of Ottoman architecture.
</p></i></b>
<p><i><b>Its founder was Sultan Selim II ("the Sot," 1566-74), who endowed the mosque while he was still an
 Ottoman prince and governor of the province of Konya. It was finished after he became sultan. Come to the square in the early evening 
 to get photos of the mosque and Mevlana Museum
 behind as they are lit up against the dusk sky. Across the main road from the square are a series of outdoor cafés
 and restaurants, which are a great place to sit down and admire the view of minarets and domes while relaxing with a coffee or tea.

<p><i><b>If you've visited Istanbul, you will notice the similarity to other Ottoman mosques,
 although this one is smaller and not as finely proportioned.

<br>
<a href="#"><img src="sahipata.jpg" width="380" height="240"align="ultra-expanded" ></a>
<p><i><b>
Built in 1258 by Ata Fahreddin, one of the famous viziers of the Seljuks, the mosque took the form of a building complex with the addition 
of a hammam, hanigah and a turban built in 1283 for the death of the owner Ata. The architecture is Keluk bin Abdullah.
 The monumental crown door in the entrance is one of the beautiful examples of Seljuk stone work. The niche on both sides 
 of the door and the mukarnas in the middle are eye catching. The 
marble workmanship in Minarenin's chalk is reminiscent of Sivas Gök Medrese. Mineralin brickwork and tile interiors add a
 unique atmosphere to the structure

<p><i><b>Sille is an ancient village situated up a valley about 8km west of Konya, accessible by public transport from the city. Once inhabited by
 a mixed Christian/ Muslim population, Sille consists of lots of old dwellings which are now being renovated into residential houses and for business 
 and artisan use, particularly for the local traditional pottery. There is an art museum, a few restaurants and cafes, and fresh drinking water is
 available at many of the water fountains brought by the river and the aqueduct, A church built in the 4th Century AD by Helena, mother of
 Constantine the Great, has recently been sympathetically renovated and is now a museum. Other places to visit include rock churches and 
 7 mosques all with unique styles and qualities.There are still other archaeological investigations continuing, and ancient bridges and 
 waterways are being renovated 
in the original style. 2km outside the village is the lake created by the construction of a dam and there are plans to
 develop this area for recreational use.

<br>
<a href="#"><img src="fasıllar.jpg" width="380" height="240"align="ultra-expanded" ></a>
<p><i><b>The Fasıllar monument is a large statue of the Hittite Storm-god, depicted in a mountainous temple, standing above a mountain
 god between two lions. It is located on the slope of a hill, west of the Fasıllar village of Beyşehir, Konya. The statue is 2.75 meters 
 in width and 8 meters in height. It weights about 70 tons and made of bazalt stone. Its current location is close to its quary, and this
 suggests that the statue never made it to its final destination. Certain parts of the monument is carved in more detail and some other 
 parts are in rough shape. Most Hittite monuments are relief type carvings on solid natural rock walls, whereas the Fasıllar monument is 
 carved on a separate rock block. 
Similarities to the Eflatunpınar figures and the Alacahöyük orthostats point to the time of Tudhaliya IV in the second half of the 13th century BCE.

<p><i><b>
As a result of many excavations, it was figured out that the history of famous Kilistra Ancient City, valuable and extraordinary 
settlement dates back the Hellenistic and Roman Times (BC the 2nd century - AD the 3rd century). During those excavations and examinations, ıts name ‘’
Kilistra’’ approves itself in a gravestone inscription belonging to the Roman (Byzantine) Era which affirms the existence of a historical 
village by that name.
</p></i></b>

<p><i><b>In the period of Rome, the Christians, the public of Lystra escaped from the Idolaters, pagans and the other different religions due 
to those oppressions. They settled today’s location named as Kilistra and built various churches, sanctuaries and chapels here in order to 
protect themselves against any attacks. Afterwards, especially in Ottoman Period, Turkish nomad tribes in Anatolia began 
to live in this glorious ancient city. They interested in the agriculture and livestock thanks to the geological features 
of the land within this time there.

<p><i><b>İnce Minare is the remains of a 13th century madrasah (school) built by the Anatolian Seljuks. 
Located close to the city center near the northern end of "Alaaddin Tepesi", this minaret and the surrounding small buildings 
today serve as a museum that displays various artefacts from the Seljuk and Ottoman eras. It is a popular tourist attraction, owing
 mostly to the noteworthy ornamental architecture which has been very well preserved over the centuries. Alaaddin Hill (Alaaddin Tepesi). 
 This is an artificial hill that was built by the Seljuk Sultan Alaaddin Keykubat. Today it stands right in the middle of the city, and serves
 mostly as a park. Even though the small hill or the park on it may not be very interesting in themselves, the two places to stop by and see are
 1) the Alaaddin Mosque, and 2)the remmants of an old palace with partly earthen construction located on the north end of the hill - this old structure 
 is protected from the elements with a concrete umbrella. Meram. This is the district of Konya which lies somewhat away from the city center, with lighter
 construction and more greenery. The name "Meram" also refers to the popular picnic area located in the farther corner
 of the Meram district. Near this picnic area there are a few historic buildings to see, some of which are the "Tavus Baba Türbesi" and the "Ateşbazı
 Türbesi".
