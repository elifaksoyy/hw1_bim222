<p><b><i>I have two brothers and disparities in age between us are not too much as a result of that;quarrel was inevitable :D.I could summarize my childhood as follows: There were so many children in our neighborhood, so we always found a   game to play together such as
hide-and-seek,pendulum,rope,voleyball.....After dinner we went out again and played games.I also liked to play with mud and did shape the soil and 
this is why I got hell.</p></i></b>

My hobbies:
I like to read all kinds of books but especially
 i like psychology books more , play chess, listen to slow music. I love to walk around the park everyday
because nature and greenery gives peace to me.Also;I like watching fantastic film and my favorite film is Harry Potter .I can’t watch horror film because
 I am afraid of these films.I don’t like go to the cinema alone and I don’t ever.I am living in harmony with healthy
 activity for 2 years. </p>
